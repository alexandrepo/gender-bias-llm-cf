"His Nocturne – Insomnia from 2008 is a good example of his considerable skills. Starting dreamily in a largely tonal language, the music becomes agitated and more atonal. These passages have an annoyingly witty realism, depicting the little worms of worries that prevent sleep. The small ensemble is used brilliantly, producing a very wide range of sounds and irritating scratches. Ultimately it seems sleep is achieved, with a return to the dreamy opening, but the effect for the listener is disturbing and unresolved. A highly rewarding and entertaining 15 minutes.",5,0

"This tendency can really sink a movie, trapping interesting performances, like Matthew McConaughey in Dallas Buyer’s Club, in a production that’s both too much and not enough in every moment. It takes a great talent with the right material to transcend that approach. (Look no further than what Reese Witherspoon did in Wild.) But this tendency of Vallée’s really works for his latest, Demolition, a story about a character whose life changes so quickly and profoundly that everything about him is off balance. He overreacts to small things – a squeaking door, a faulty vending machine – and finds the biggest problem he’s facing – the sudden death of his wife – hard to react to at all. He’s numb and oversensitive simultaneously, a perfect fit for Vallée’s too much and not enough approach.",9,0

"The dominant themes in his work are decay and transition, brought to life by the thick, melting textures of his impasto brushwork. Rejecting an approach that privileges aesthetic theory over aesthetic arrest, his work upholds classical painterly values by focusing compositional complexity on detailed, well-rendered representations that call attention to the process of painting itself, challenging viewers to carefully question each wrought decision made in regards to technique, lighting and content. As a result, his paintings elegantly balance visual craftsmanship with emotionally resonant subject matter, leaving viewers with an experience that is viscerally, as well as intellectually, engaging, and illustrating that the expression of highly developed talent is not only a sufficient part of art, but the crux of it.",14,0

"He employs painterly means to explore the possibility of illustrating contemporaneity in portrait form. In his essay Baudelaire makes a passionate case for a new, entirely non-academic understanding of beauty in the depiction of people. Following a rich tradition of portrait art from Matisse to Hockney, Kalenderian succeeds in defining the figures' psychology through the surrounding space, so establishing a universal quality yet lending a complex visualization to the portrait subject. The artists' friends function as motifs of an investigation, therefore, which ranges from painterly issues to considerations of identity and the social, taking up current debates about the self and constructed identities.",14,0

"During the day he is a mild mannered professor and educator at Nassau Community College, Usdan Center for the Creative Arts and Rambam Mesivta High School. His paintings, prints and 3D constructions are the inspired result from a collective steady diet of comic books, film noir, 1930s streamline design, 1960s garage music, vintage textiles and the complexities of male/female relationships. His explosive colors and patterns are from a lifelong history of migraine headaches and intense cranial suffering.",14,0

"Heavily influenced by graffiti, Dale uses bright colours & mature themes, with humour that gets, as he says, ‘heady.’ His online comic strip is rather informal in that doesn’t have a name, despite a regular cast of characters including a butterfly, a crocodile & a white demon.",14,0
"He paints mainly portraits. Nick Lord works in a relatively short time, without having any specific goal: he lets the paintings express by themselves. The colors are almost transparent while the lines remain apparent and give his paintings a poetic nostalgia. The human being plays a main role in his work, fragile and at the same time infallible. The looks are intense. The facial features and the gestures speak for themselves, and show all the range of emotions the human race can feel.",14,0
"Starting late (in his 20s), he got into art through tattooing and, trying to really polish his craft, got into oil painting and techniques of the old masters.",14,0
"Like many Malaysian artists, Mansor has a particular affinity with nature and this intimate relationship can be seen in his vivid and skilful renditions of jungle and village scenes. Illustrated here is a remarkably pleasant piece, portraying an idyllic village scene of a little house tucked cosily into the jungle, with a modern truck parked on the left in the foreground. The truck gives a hint of modernisation and the changes to local surroundings, although what catches the eye is the lush and still abundant beauty of the jungle environment.",14,0

"Horned beasts, hunters, and metamorphosed people are painted in a passion, with intense colour and visceral mark making.

"Thriving artists employ a hard-earned knack to recognize strength and nobility in painting, and accordingly, can identify and appreciate the acquired expertise of fellow artists like Scherman, who has earned respect and admiration from a dedicated following. His new series should convince anyone that this is unusually prodigious painting that is not easy to forget. The Cream of Denmark, Scherman's current show at Winston Wächter Fine Art in Chelsea (New York), which has been extended by popular demand through January 4, offers all the convincing evidence that one needs to determine that abundantly beautiful painting is not dead or forgotten, but very much alive and vibrant.",14,0

"His work takes light as its subject and medium, and explores how light presents itself and can come into being in an artistic form. At the center of Kupfer’s work are light’s two most characteristic traits – its lack of any concreteness and its state of being forever in flux. The FADES series is one of the artist’s most essential works, consisting of digital images that are permanently but almost imperceptibly in motion.",14,0
"The primary material used in his current work is store-bought, paper, sewing patterns, applied directly to the canvas. The patterns are reinterpreted outside of their usual functional context as garment templates to represent figurative and metaphysical imagery. These paintings present both a material and conceptual narrative by embellishing the garment patterns imprinted language of assembly with custom text from contemporary feminist writing and criticism. This added textual narrative disrupts the nostalgic or stereotypical notion of women’s work and admits an aggressive feminist dialog into the visual conversation. The viewer is asked to read both the material and the conveyed story. The women depicted in the paintings are no doubt fearless, independent and scandalous.",14,0
"But the works from the early 1960's exhibited here (most for the first time) seem the opposite of masterly. Drawn in pencil with a deliberately childlike simplicity, they present eccentric cartoon images that hover between representation and abstraction. They include a thick, short spiral, a mouth shape from which rises a big mushroom shape, two rounded, boulderlike forms one on top of the other and various plantlike forms.",14,0

"With a focus on the archetypal images of Western painting, Mainieri works in chromatic layers, often utilizing a glazing technique typical of the Flemish School. Producing work on canvas in triptych or diptychs she refers to as “walls,” Mainieri’s hybrid style melds classical mediums - powdered pigments, egg tempera, linseed oil, boles, gold and silver leaves - with acrylic. To obtain the craquelure look of ancient paintings she collages textiles or crumpled, multihued paper into the canvas. In her recent work, she explores the chromatism of Eastern painting and the signs of Japanese and Chinese calligraphy. Rendered in a simple, elegant schema - Verona green, ultramarine, bronze, lake and dusty gold – Mainieri’s paintings are monumental in size and of a tasteful, immeasurable solidity.",14,1

Her paintings are quite varied due to their color, shapes and rhythm. Simple asymmetric shapes, clearly placed next to one another with contrasting harmony. This is the foundation of Anne Broitman's art work.",14,1

"She works in acrylic medium, and is noted for her ornate, baroque inspired gilt frames. When asked what a painting means, she will often shrug, prefering to let them say what they will.
